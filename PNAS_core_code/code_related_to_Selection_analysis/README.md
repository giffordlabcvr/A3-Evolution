# Analytical code and materials used in the selection analysis
## Description
Codon sites under the diversifying selection were detected using **HyPhy MEME** (https://stevenweaver.github.io/hyphy-site/methods/selection-methods/).  

The following materials used in the selection analysis (conducted by **Ito et. al., 2019, PNAS**) are available in this directory:  
1) script to run **HyPhy MEME** (**./hyphy/batch_MEME.sh**)  
2) Multiple sequence alignments (**./codon-based_MSA/<APOBEC Class>.aligned.codon_seq_selected_pos.fas**)  
3) Phylogenetic trees (**./tree/<APOBEC Class>.aligned.codon.nwk**)  

Detailed information is available in the header of the script.
